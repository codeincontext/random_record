random_record
===

random_record is a plugin that adds a 'random' method to all ActiveRecord classes. It will return a random record of that class from the database. It also accepts find conditions.

Other solutions either require loading a list of all IDs in the table to choose from, or pick a random number, then check that a record of that ID exists in the table. Both seem silly to me.

Installation
===

I guess you want to install as a plugin:
    script/plugin install git://github.com/skattyadz/random_record.git

Usage
===

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
end

Post.random # returns a random record from the 'posts' table

Post.random(:public=>true) # returns a random, public record
